# Triangle

# Architecture and models:

At first you will choose a number indicating the number of lines of the pyramid you want to build, but to do so you must first follow a few conditions: 
a full positive number, less than 25.

# Development:

If you don't want to try the webpage, you only have to click on this [link ](https://meriambs.github.io/Triangle/).

If you are more interested in knowing the code and maybe add new things you can clone it using those steps:

1- Under the repository name, click Clone or download.

2- In the Clone with HTTPs section, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository. 

3- Open the terminal.

4- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

5- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.

6- Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

# Peculiarity:

1-if you choose a number greater than 25 a window will appear indicating that this is not possible.
If you put a negative or a symbol character won't work, you will see nothing in the console.

2-When you enter the number nothing is displayed!!! Thatâ€™s ok, indeed the pyramid is displayed in the console so I invite you to go see it.
